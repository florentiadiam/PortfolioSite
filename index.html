                <h3>Computer Graphics project, 3D scene with controllable bee</h3>
                <p>This project focuses on creating an interactive 3D scene. We created a panorama, a flower garden with randomized variability, a pile of rocks topped with a hive, and an animated, controllable (with keys) bee that interacts with pollen and the hive. The scene also contains realistic grass animated with shaders to simulate wind effects. To understand the project better, there is an MP4 video included in the zip file. This project was implemented with JavaScript and CGF.</p>

                <h3>Parallel and Distributed Computing Project, Client-Server Interface</h3>
                <p>In this project, we made a Client-Server interface for a simple multiplayer game, Rock Paper Scissors. The player first has to log in, then choose between simple and rank mode, and the server adds them to a queue. When the match is over, the server prints if the player lost, won, or if it was a tie. In case the player disconnects, they could reconnect with a session token and be added to the queue again. This project was implemented with Java.</p>

                <h3>Artificial Intelligence Project 1, Terrace Game</h3>
                <p>Using Python and the Pygame library, we created the Terrace Game, famous from the Star Trek movies. Terrace is an abstract board game played by two players on a multi-leveled board. You can choose between two modes: player vs. player or player vs. AI. Our AI uses the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. For more details, check the PDF in the repository.</p>

                <h3>Artificial Intelligence Project 2, Evasive PDF samples</h3>
                <p>This project involved a dataset of Evasive PDF samples with 21 features containing 500,000 generated evasive samples. Of these, 450,000 are malicious, and 50,000 are benign PDFs. The goal was to predict which of them are malicious. We achieved this using supervised learning models, which we trained using training sets and then evaluated using a test set.</p>

                <p>Working in Scrum teams, we developed an app using Flutter called ReBrand. This app focuses on donations and raising money for charity organizations. As a user, you can either choose to buy clothes or donate clothes or money to these organizations.</p>
